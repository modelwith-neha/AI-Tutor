# AI-Tutor
Hackathon project - To create a Data Science AI tutor with GPU acceleration knowledge as well. Created a semi-socratic, game based tutor which has flashcards , game mode and point system to interest you.
üß† M^6 AI Tutor: Data Science & GPU Acceleration Assistant

Overview

M^6 AI Tutor is an interactive, gamified tutor system designed for students and professionals exploring Data Science and GPU Acceleration. It uses:
	‚Ä¢	RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with a FAISS vector index
	‚Ä¢	LLM fallback (Falcon-7B-Instruct) for poor RAG results
	‚Ä¢	Interactive game modes: flashcards, quizzes, and coding puzzles

‚∏ª

Features

üîç Tutor Mode
	‚Ä¢	Ask any Data Science or GPU-related question
	‚Ä¢	Smart response via RAG over curated URLs (cuDF, RAPIDS, CUDA, pandas, sklearn, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Fallback to LLM (Falcon-7B-Instruct) if RAG yields poor results
	‚Ä¢	Automatic polishing of RAG answers
	‚Ä¢	Related question suggestions and GPU benchmark graphs (plotly)

üéÆ Game Mode
	‚Ä¢	Flashcards to review core concepts (e.g., CUDA, cuDF)
	‚Ä¢	Quizzes with multiple-choice questions to earn points
	‚Ä¢	Coding Puzzle: Convert CPU (pandas) code to GPU (cuDF) and simulate speedup

How it Works

1. RAG Pipeline
	‚Ä¢	URLs are scraped using BeautifulSoup
	‚Ä¢	Text is chunked, embedded with SentenceTransformers
	‚Ä¢	Indexed via FAISS
	‚Ä¢	User queries retrieve top-K chunks for context

2. Fallback with Falcon-7B
	‚Ä¢	If no good RAG content is found, a helpful prompt is passed to Falcon-7B
	‚Ä¢	LLM answers are optionally followed with a documentation link

3. Plotting Benchmarks
	‚Ä¢	When queries involve GPU/benchmarking, a dynamic CPU vs GPU plot is shown

Installation

pip install gradio torch transformers sentence-transformers faiss-cpu beautifulsoup4 requests plotly

Use faiss-gpu if you want GPU acceleration for indexing.

File Structure

üìÅ DataSci-GPU-Tutor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tutor_app.py              # Full Python app (this script)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chunks.pkl                # Cached scraped chunks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ faiss.index               # FAISS vector index
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ custom_urls.txt           # List of RAG URLs


‚∏ª

Run the App

python tutor_app.py

It will launch a Gradio web app with two tabs:
	‚Ä¢	Tutor Mode: Ask questions
	‚Ä¢	Game Mode: Flashcards | Quiz | Coding Puzzle

Future Enhancements
	‚Ä¢	Chat-style UI
	‚Ä¢	User auth + progress tracking
	‚Ä¢	More advanced quizzes with explanations
	‚Ä¢	Upload your own notes for RAG
